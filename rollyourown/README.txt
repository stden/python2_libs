Roll Your Own is a series of frameworks that help Django developers have their
perfection by rolling their own apps instead of plugging someone else's.  Each
framework promotes customised, modular and efficient ecommerce apps.

Philosophy

    * use frameworks and tools, not apps
    * write highly customised apps/sites
    * live only in the now, write for today's requirements
    * avoid using apps that have fixed opinions/decisions
    * developer free to have/make their own opinions/decisions 

Django itself does exactly that, but many of the "reusable apps" that are 
developed on top of django don't continue this philosophy 

Commerce Framework  (rollyourown.commerce)
------------------------------------------

A framework to help caluclate totals for financial statements and organise
self rolled applications that do this.
